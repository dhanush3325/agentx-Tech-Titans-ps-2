## Problem Statement  
*PS2: Gamified Learning Environment for AgentX*

The objective of this project is to design and implement a gamified learning environment where an AI agent (AgentX) can train, evolve, and demonstrate intelligent behavior. The environment emphasizes game mechanics, reward shaping, scoring systems, and agent progression to encourage efficient learning and problem-solving.

---

## Approach Overview  

We designed *Puzzleverse*, a dynamic puzzle-based game world where AgentX learns through interaction and reinforcement learning.

### Key Concepts:
- AgentX explores a grid-based environment
- Solves puzzles, avoids traps, and collects rewards
- Learns optimal behavior through rewards and penalties
- Progresses through levels with increasing difficulty

---

## Game Mechanics  

- *Environment*: Grid world with mazes, keys, traps, and goals  
- *Actions*:
  - Move (Up, Down, Left, Right)
  - Collect items
  - Solve puzzles
- *Episodes*: Each episode presents a new environment layout

---

## Agent Design  

- *Agent*: AgentX (Reinforcement Learning Agent)
- *State Space*:
  - Agent position
  - Nearby obstacles
  - Items collected
- *Action Space*:
  - Navigation actions
  - Interaction actions
- *Algorithm Used*:
  - Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning / Deep Q-Network – conceptual)
